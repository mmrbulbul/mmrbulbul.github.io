**Introduction**

Although Japan may not be the first destination that comes to mind for IT engineers, I found myself moving here in 2019 after securing a job. Since then, I've received numerous questions from friends, colleagues, and others curious about the tech industry, job culture, and life in Japan as a foreign engineer. With more people reaching out recently, I decided it was time to put together this article.

In this post, I'll provide an overview of the essential skills needed, language requirements, job search strategies, and tips for adapting to the unique work culture in Japan.

A bit about myself:

- Graduated in 2018 (CSE, University of Dhaka)
- Moved to Japan in 2019
- Working as a Software Engineer (Usen-Almex)
- Japanes Level: N2~N3 (offical JLPT not taken) 



**1. Understanding the Japanese IT Industry**

Japan has long been recognized for its innovation in technology, particularly in fields like robotics, electronics, and automotive engineering. When it coems to software it somehow fell behind. However, the Japanese IT industry is undergoing a transformation, becoming an increasingly attractive destination for tech professionals worldwide. The market is evolving due to several key factors:

- Digital Transformation: Japanese companies, including traditional giants, are actively pursuing digital transformation to remain competitive in a global market. (Checkout [Woven-planet](https://woven.toyota/en/))

-  The Japanese government is encouraging digital innovation and technological advancement through initiatives such as "Society 5.0," which aims to create a smart society by integrating AI, IoT, big data, and robotics into various sectors.

**2. The language barrier**

**3. Job culture**

Japan is notoriously well known for it's long working hour. This might be still true in general but things have changed a lot since the pendamic, most of the company adopted remote/ hybrid working style. 

Most companies expect you to work 40h/week. This might change due to nature of your job. 

Overtime is paid in most companies

**3. Job Search Strategies**

- **Networking:** Talk about the importance of networking in Japan, including attending meetups, conferences, and joining online communities.
- **Job Portals and Recruitment Agencies:** List popular job portals and recruitment agencies that specialize in IT roles in Japan (e.g., LinkedIn, Wantedly, Daijob).
- **Company-Specific Applications:** Suggest directly applying to companies known for hiring international talent.

**4. Navigating the Interview Process**

- Describe what to expect during interviews (e.g., coding tests, technical rounds, HR interviews).
- Share tips on preparing for cultural questions or assessments (e.g., teamwork, work ethics).

**5. Adapting to the Japanese Work Culture**

- Discuss the cultural differences in the workplace, such as hierarchy, work-life balance, and communication styles.
- Provide advice on how to adapt and thrive in a Japanese work environment.

**6. My journey**

I was recruited by a Japanese dispatch company via on-campus recruitment during my university 3rd year. 
They arranged in-class Japanese lessons (6 months), paid for the plain fair and arranged my initial living place in Japan.

As far as I know they stopped from hiring Bangladesh directly. You can still apply if you have JLPT N3 or above. I would rather advocate for applying directly.

**7. Conclusion**

- Summarize the key points and encourage aspiring engineers to pursue opportunities in Japan.
- Offer some final words of advice or encouragement.

**Call to Action**

- Invite readers to share their questions, experiences, or connect with you for further guidance.
